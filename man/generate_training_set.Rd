\title{Splits an scMethrix object into two for use as a training and test set}
\usage{
generate_training_set(scm = NULL, training_prop = 0.2, seed = "123")
}
\arguments{
\item{scm}{\code{\link{scMethrix}}; the single cell methylation experiment}

\item{training_prop}{numeric; The size of the training set as a proportion of the experiment (0 to 1)
For a range, the optimal value will be estimated; this is time-intensive.}

\item{seed}{string; value to use for sampling}
}
\value{
list; two \code{\link{scMethrix}} objects names 'training' and 'test'
}
\description{
Splits an scMethrix object into two for use as a training and test set
}
\details{
Typically used for teaching classification algorithms. The seed can be set for consistency.

\examples{
data('scMethrix_data')
generate_training_set(scMethrix_data, training_prop = 0.2)
